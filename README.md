# NEW
This is going to be something completely new.

This is not the repo you're looking for...

# The only thing that changes is _everything_
A lot of changes at once 
- own persistence (own file) instead of shared config.json with homebridge
- all new concept: no native services any more, but using the defaults from HAP-NodeJS
- all new concept: define group addresses with more parameters and assign them to characteristics
- tidied up the room: new keywords for the knx_config.json (buh, a lot of work for you to do!)


# pipeline
Web interface for configuration
