# homebridge-knx
KNX platform shim for homebridge.
This cannot run stand-alone!

## This Work In Progress, use carefully.
Please also visit homebridge github homepage first

## Currently homebridge does not support npm modules. The KNX integration is currently built into homebridge, so you don't need this norm module yet.
