You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/knxd/knxd). I have mirrored an ancient snapshot that runs stable *with my configuration* (raspberry 1b, busware pigator single with knx module) but has not been tested otherwise. I cannot support the knxd. Please address issues directly at the [knxd issue pages](https://github.com/knxd/knxd/issues). It might help to search the existing issues, as your problem might have been solved already.  \r\n\r\n### Installation and running\r\n-  Install homebridge first, [see there](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge); nfarina recommends a global install as super user. It's a server tool, so we can safely assume that the person that installes it is sufficiently  priviledged to do so. `sudo npm install -g homebridge`\r\n-  then install this package to `<any>` directory you want; If you installed homebridge globally I recommend to do so with homebridge-knx: `sudo npm install -g homebridge-knx`\r\n-  configure homebridge and its plugins. You might start by copying the [`KNX-sample-config.json`](KNX-sample-config.json) to a new folder `.homebridge` in your user folder (on a default installation raspberry, it's `/home/pi`) and rename it to config.json\r\n- Then put the configuration file*knx_config.json* into `~/.homebridge`, and adapt them to your needs (knxd address and some test devices in `knx_config.json`). You do not need a `platform` section in `config.json`any more!\r\n-  Eliminate everything (especially all group addresses) that might harm your KNX installation. Sending bus telegrams to your alarm device might wake the neighbourhood unpleasantly!\r\n-  when done, start homebridge with `homebridge`. If you have chosen a local install, go to the homebridge folder and do a `bin/homebridge --plugin-path <any>/homebridge-knx` with the path to the homebridge-knx installation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\nSince homebridge-knx is not an Apple-certified HomeKit device some functions are limited:\r\n- remote access is only possible using a local device as HomeKit \"router\" (i.e. an AppleTV 3rd/4th gen, or an iPad running iOS10)\r\n\r\n\r\n## NEW VERSION 0.3.0\r\nThis **is** something completely new.\r\n\r\n# The only thing that changes is _everything_\r\nA lot of changes at once \r\n- own persistence (own file) instead of shared config.json with homebridge *(knx_config.json in homebridge home directory, next to homebridge's config.json)*\r\n- all new concept: no native services any more, but using the defaults from HAP-NodeJS\r\n- you can now assign *any* characteristic to *any* service, until Apple's homekit says that's incomplient.\r\n- ~~all new concept: define group addresses with more parameters and assign them to characteristics~~\r\n- tidied up the room: new keywords for the *knx_config.json* (buh, a lot of work for you to do!)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Assumptions\r\nWithout using a special handler (add-in) for the service, homebridge-knx assumes the following:\r\n\r\nHomeKit type | KNX addresses DPT   \r\n-------- | ------  \r\nBoolean | DPT1  \r\nInteger | DPT5  \r\nPercentage | DPT5.001  \r\nFloat | DPT9  \r\n\r\n\r\n# knx_config.json\r\n\r\n*Devices* instead of *accessories*:  \r\n\r\n```json\r\n\t\"Devices\": [ \r\n\t\t{ \r\n\t\t\t\"DeviceName\": \"device name\" \r\n\t\t\t...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n```\r\nChanged capitalization (harmonized)!  \r\n\r\nSee the [complete Doc!](knx_config.json.md).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Add-ins\r\nAdd-in (aka handlers) can change the default behavior. [See the article](handler-add-in.md)\r\n\r\n# Removing stale accessories from homebridge cache\r\nThe new (well, 1/2016) API of homebridge allows homebridge to cache the accessories for platforms that can add or remove accessories during runtime. As a next step in evolution, homebridge-knx already connects to that API.  \r\n\r\n**Allow homebridge-knx to start the webserver by adding `\"AllowWebserver\":true,` at the beginning of your knx_config.json!**\r\n\r\nAs a consequence remain devices, that homebridge-knx does not reconnnect to at start-up, stale and unreachable in HomeKit. To remove those shadows from HomeKit, use the little web server at `<your-homebridge>:18081/list`\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11786396/19836160/5d1ddcde-9e98-11e6-8dc2-e621aceb1055.png)  \r\nClicking on the `delete from cache` link will **only** remove the devices from the current homebridge instance and their cache, **not** from the *knx_config.json*, that means they will be rediscovered upon next startup as new device in the default room!\r\n\r\n# Killing homebridge\r\n**This is for debugging of your knx_config.json only.** If you need homebridge to restart, you can use the setting `\"AllowKillHomebridge\":true` in your knx_config.json (right on top where the knxd properties are).  \r\nYou'll get a new link at the bottom of the page at `<your-homebridge>:18081/list` that will homebridge-knx to throw an excpetion (\"Committed_Suicide\") which then causes homebridge to fail.  \r\n*You should remove this setting after completing your knx_config.json for security reasons!* \r\n\r\n\r\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/homebridge-knx\r\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/homebridge-knx.svg\r\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/homebridge-knx.svg\r\n[david-dm-url]:https://david-dm.org/snowdd1/homebridge-knx\r\n[david-dm-image]:https://david-dm.org/snowdd1/homebridge-knx.svg\r\n",
